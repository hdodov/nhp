Node Hypertext Preprocessor is a templating engine for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with support for [Express](https://expressjs.com/). It does things the Node way by treating templates like modules, allowing you to write [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) code, while also giving you the ability to use the entirety of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) in your app!
