# Getting Started

First of all, you should have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Then, you should open a terminal, create a folder for your project, and run `npm init` to create a `package.json` file for your projects. Read more on that [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/).

Once you have your project set up, you should install NHP by running:

```
npm install nhp --save
```
